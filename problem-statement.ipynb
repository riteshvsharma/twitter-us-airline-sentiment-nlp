    "Hi Learners,\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the project on NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background and Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter possesses 330 million monthly active users, which allows businesses to reach a broad population and connect with customers without intermediaries. On the other hand, there’s so much information that it’s difficult for brands to quickly detect negative social mentions that could harm their business.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why sentiment analysis/classification, which involves monitoring emotions in conversations on social media platforms, has become a key strategy in social media marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Listening to how customers feel about the product/service on Twitter allows companies to understand their audience, keep on top of what’s being said about their brand and their competitors, and discover new trends in the industry.\n",

    "Data Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as \"late flight\" or \"rude service\").\n",

    "Best Practices for the Notebook : \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing comments on the observations and insights.\n",
    "The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential manner before submission.\n",
    "It is preferable to remove all warnings and errors before submission.\n",

    "\n",
    "Submission Guidelines :\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission should be a well-commented Jupyter notebook [format - .html and .ipynb]\n",
    "Any assignment found copied/plagiarized with other groups will not be graded and will be awarded zero marks.\n",
    "Please ensure timely submission as any submission post-deadline will not be accepted for evaluation\n",

    "Add your view and opinion along with the problem statement, Import the libraries, load dataset, print the shape of data, data description.\n",
    "2.5\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "Do Exploratory data analysis(EDA) based on the below statement. (9 Marks) a. Plot the distribution of all tweets among each airline & plot the distribution of sentiment across all the tweets. b. Plot the distribution of Sentiment of tweets for each airline & plot the distribution of all the negative reasons. c. Plot the word cloud graph of tweets for positive and negative sentiment separately. Mention the observations & insights after plotting each graph.\n",

    "Understanding of Data Columns\n",
    "Understand of data columns: (3 Marks) a. Drop all other columns except “text” and “airline_sentiment”. b. Check the shape of the data. c. Print the first 5 rows of data.\n",
    "1.5\n",
    "Data Pre - Processing\n",
    "Text pre-processing: Data preparation. NOTE:- Each text pre-processing step should be mentioned in the notebook separately. a. Html tag removal. b. Tokenization. c. Remove the numbers. d. Removal of Special Characters and Punctuations. e. Removal of stopwords f. Conversion to lowercase. g. Lemmatize or stemming. h. Join the words in the list to convert back to text string in the data frame. (So that each row contains the data in text format.) i. Print the first 5 rows of data after pre-processing.\n",
