    "1. How should one approach the Twitter US Airline Sentiment project?\n",
    "Before starting the project, please read the problem statement carefully and go through the criteria and descriptions mentioned in the rubric.\n",
    "Once you understand the task, download and import the dataset into a Jupyter/Colab notebook to get started with the project.\n",
    "Start by adding your view and opinion along with the problem statement, the shape of the data, and the data description.\n",
    "Keep the structure and flow of the notebook as mentioned in the rubric.\n",
    "It is important to finish the notebook with a summary from the understanding of the application of various pre-processing, vectorization, and performance of the model on the dataset.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What does that mean by \"Note: Each text pre-processing step should be mentioned in the notebook separately\" of step 3 in the problem statement?\n",
    "You are expected to apply each pre-processing function on the required column one at a time & print the first few rows after applying each time.\n",

    "3. I keep getting the following error while installing spacy:\n",
    "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'spacy'\n",
    "How to fix this issue?\n",
    "Please try using the following code to install spacy:\n",
    "\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge spacy\n",
    "It is not mandatory to use spacy for performing the text pre-processing step of this project.\n",

    "5. Do we need to follow the exact sequence in pre-processing?\n",
    "You can follow any order for pre-processing, as long as you are able to perform the further steps of the project after pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Do I have to convert the sentiment column values to integers before training the model?\n",
    "It is not mandatory to encode the target column before training the model. You can proceed with modeling without encoding too.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Which classification algorithm should I use to fit the model for this project?\n",
    "You can apply any classification algorithm which has been covered in the course so far. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Can I perform any additional pre-processing steps apart from the ones that are mentioned in the list?\n",
    "You are expected to include all text pre-processing step that is asked in the project problem statement. Yes, you can also include additional pre-processing steps apart from the ones that are mentioned in the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "9. I received the following error:'list' object has no attribute 'lower' after applying the Countvectorizer.\n",
    "You have to re-join the words into the text string after undergoing all the pre-processing steps including tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "10. Project Rubric did not mention Unsupervised Learning Methods such as VADER and TextBlob based sentiment analysis. Can we assume that VADER and TextBlob based work is not expected?\n",
    "Yes, you are not expected to apply the Unsupervised Learning Methods such as VADER and TextBlob for this project. There are no separate marks for it but we encourage exploring every approach/technique for this project along with the asked steps for this project.\n",

    "11. What does it mean by “Plot the distribution of all tweets among each airline & plot the distribution of sentiment across all the tweets.” of step 2a?\n",
    "The instruction requires you to plot the distribution of count proportion of tweets for each airline and for different sentiment labels, respectively. In order to analyse the dataset better, it would be convenient to know the number of tweets every airline is receiving and how that number compares with the ones for other airlines. It is also important to know the count of tweets for every sentiment in order to determine the general opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, one simple plot to compare the number of tweets received by each airline and a plot to compare the number of tweets belonging to every sentiment label would suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "12. What does it mean by “Plot the distribution of Sentiment of tweets for each airline & plot the distribution of all the negative reasons” of step 2b?\n",
    "The instruction requires you to plot the distribution of tweets in the various sentiment labels for all the airlines. This plot will enable every airline to know which sentiment is mostly shown towards them and how does it compare with the other sentiments. It also encourages the comparison between the different airlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "“ Plot the distribution of all the negative reasons” requires you to plot the negative reason along its count. This plot will help you to know which reasons are responsible for the major negative tweets."
